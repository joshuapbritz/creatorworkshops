            <h1>Who We Are</h1>
            <div class="about-body">
                <p>
                    Creator Workshops is a small business founded in 2017 focused on personal interaction with our students. 
                    We use LEGO® Education materials to provide learners with a fundamental knowledge of the principles of 
                    engineering and technology in a way that is both instructive and entertaining. Everything we teach students 
                    is based on a Biblical worldview of science and technology, which we pass on to students through teaching,
                    discussion, debate and application.
                </p>
                <p>Our founder and primary teacher is Timothy Evan Cantrell. He began by taking LEGO Engineering and Robotics classes as a student throughout his schooling. 
                    During this time his team won first place in the <a href="http://www.wrosa.co.za/" target="_blank">National Robotics Olympiad</a>                        
                    twice and represented South Africa at the <a href="http://www.wrosa.co.za/" target="_blank">World Robot Olympiad</a> in Indonesia.
                    His time as a student inspired him to continue in the LEGO Education world as a teacher. He taught for another company for several years
                    before founding Creator Workshops.  
                </p>
        
                <p>Evan is a member at Antioch Bible Church where he has served in various ministries. Because of his personal faith, Evan
                    does not want to simply use students as a source of income, but wants to rather pass on the valuable truths and skills he has learned
                    to the next generation. He has a passion for South Africa's future as a nation and under
                    God. Because of his love for South Africa, Evan declined a number of academic opportunities in the USA. Evan has a BCom Law degree from Wits and 
                    is currently in the final year of his LLB. He has signed at Clyde & Co for Practical Vocational Training 
                    as a lawyer starting in 2023. Evan is happily married, and lives in Bryanston with his wife Tarryn, who is expecting their first child.</p>

                    learnt to work with other students in a team. I am very grateful to Evan and his team for patiently and
