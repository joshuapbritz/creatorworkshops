            <p>Creator Workshops offers special classes catering to small groups of younger children. The younger children
                work from the LEGO Duplo <a href="https://www.handsontech.co.za/sets.html#!/LEGO®-Education-Early-Simple-Machines-Set/p/101059086/category=27750028"
                target="_blank">Early Simple Machines Set</a>. The main focus of these classes is helping young students to 
                develop early fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination, in addition to introducing them to fundamental concepts
                of mechanics. These essential talents are taught through enjoyable, easy models that will keep children entertained while
                they learn.

            Creator Workshops’ primary teaching material is the curriculum developed by <a href="http://www.handsontech.co.za/"
            target="_blank">Hands-on-Tech</a>. For more information about this curriculum, you can click on this
            <a href="http://www.handsontech.co.za/technology-curricula.html" target="_blank">link</a>. It is CAPS–Applicable,
            and is based off of LEGO Education’s Simple and Powered machines set (9686), which we provide
            for the use of our students. The primary objective of this course is to accustom students to the fundamentals 
            of engineering and problem-solving. Students who complete this course will be able to work with the 6 Simple Machines,
            Mechanical Advantage, and Gear Ratios, to name a few. They will also be able to apply these concepts to real world problems. 
            The Mechanics class is designed for students who wish to build a strong foundation in Mechanics and
            Structural Design before proceeding to Robotics. It is ideal for older students with less prior experience
            with Educational LEGO.

                    The Robotics course is designed for students who have extensive experience with the engineering side 
                    of LEGO Education and are ready to move on to more advanced challenges. The primary purpose of this 
                    course is to introduce students to the logic of programming and the important connection between physical
                    design and functionality. Students will have the choice to compete in the <a href="http://www.wrosa.co.za/" 
                    target="_blank">World Robot Olympiad</a>, which will give them experience with digital and real-world 
                    problem-solving, as well as experience with teamwork and working independently under pressure. Students
                    who excel in this competition may even win the chance to compete internationally.
