                        a dynamic, practical understanding of STEAM concepts. Our goal is to assist students in developing their enjoyment 
                        and comprehension of the fundamentals of engineering and problem-solving. Students have a fantastic 
                        opportunity to express their creativity as they apply their knowledge of concepts to LEGO models. 
                        Creator Workshops also sends select students to the annual World Robotics Olympiad where their capacities 
                        are stretched and matured in a competitive environment. We have something to offer to all ages!</p>

                        We offer one-day STEAM workshops at schools throughout the school year. These workshops are tailor-made 
                        to practically apply concepts students have been learning during 
                        the term to exciting LEGO engineering projects. We work with the teachers of each school to ensure 
                        that the content of the courses are relevant. Each one-day workshop is divided into individual classes 
                        where groups of students attend a presentation which pairs fundamental theory
                        with fascinating LEGO models. Contact us today for a personalised quote!
