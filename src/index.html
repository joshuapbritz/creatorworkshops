                        Education materials to provide learners with a fundamental knowledge of the principles of engineering
                        and technology in a way that is both instructive and entertaining. Everything we teach students is
                        based on a Biblical worldview of science and technology, which we pass on to students through teaching,
                        discussion, debate and application.</p>

                        "My children have attended a number of Evan’s Lego courses and I have found them to be hugely
                        beneficial. My children have now been exposed to the
                        principles of engineering and technology in a way that is not just fun, but I believe vitally
                        important in today’s generation of technology.
                        The basic computer classes offered at most schools prepares them in no way for the skills they
                        need in order to keep up with the daily progress
                        in technology, mechanics and computer engineering.
                        Being exposed to these skills through Lego building, mechanics and robotics is amazing and my
                        children have enjoyed every single lesson.
                        My daughter in particular is showing a real aptitude for engineering which I find amazing and I
                        wish we could further her skills.
                        Evan has been amazing and has really inspired my kids to enjoy and look forward to learning
                        through play. The results speak for themselves.
                        I would highly recommend him and the courses he holds to any parent or organisation who sees
                        the value in these skills."

                        wait for the classes
                        and always return excited and ready to share what they have learnt. This is saying something
                        for a class teaching
                        maths, science and engineering.”

                        “My son has really benefited from doing LEGO at Creation Workshops. He has been learning
                        important concepts regarding physics,
                        especially in the field of mechanics. Lego engineering makes this learning process fun and
                        interesting. Once my son looked at
                        an exposed engine of a bus and remarked: 'Wow! Look at that pulley system!' We were amazed,
                        because that thought didn't even
                        cross our minds. We can see that Lego has really helped to shape his mind and experience of the
                        world around him.”

                        “Lego Robotics has been an exciting and highly rewarding experience for my son Thabo. He has
                        been challenged to think outside the box
                        in the many projects he has been asked to do in class. Every time he comes back from a class he
                        can't wait to tell me what he built
                        and how he managed to overcome the obstacles which he faced building the various models
                        assigned to both him and his colleagues.
                        He has also learnt to work with other students in a team as an added bonus. I am very grateful
                        to Evan and his team for patiently
                        and gently instilling in our children a love for creativity under the creator via robotics
